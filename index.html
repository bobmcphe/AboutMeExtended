        <p>I was born in Texas, in 1988, but grew up in Kansas most of my life. I joined the military when I 
            was 17, and went active duty at 19. Consequently, I lived in the Seattle area for several
            years. After I left, I went to Florida, just north of Orlando, to study theology, then 
            England to study philosophy. My wife and I own a home in Florida and we have three wonderful
            daughters, with another child on the way soon. 
        </p>
        <p>I am the oldest child of two siblings, a brother and sister. Tragically, I lost my sister in February 2019, and flew
            home from the UK for the funeral. Further, I grew up most of my life without my father, who died when I was about 12. 
            As a child I grew up poor, and had to earn everything I made. But this has worked to a benefit, being able to understand
            the value of a hard earned dollar, and creating a hard work ethic. Much of my time in my youth was spent reading, but 
            still a healthy amount of playing out doors. In high school, my best friend was Levi, whom I am still in contact with today.
            During our time at school, we would spend a lot of time fooling around; turning on TV's with PDA's, setting up VNC servers
            at the schools, and various other things that got me into trouble a few times. 
        </p>
        <p>Things I still enjoy to this day, about 15 years later:</p>

            <h2 id="ed">Education</h2>
            <span><p>As previously mentioned, I have a few degrees from a few locations. I received an honors degree in theology from a 
                new and local Bible college located in Sanford, FL. This degree entailed history, theology, philosophy, Latin and literature,
                and that is it. That is, no math--to my great joy and pleasure. Upon graduating, I decided to study a degree in philosophy,
                a one year research degree under the tutelage of Sir Roger Scruton, at the University of Buckingham. This was great, since there 
                was no homework or tests...just the reading and writing of my giant thesis. Of course, it was coupled with some beautiful seminars,
                food and even guest lecturers on various topics, all at the Reform Club. However, theology and philosophy are fields that, while
                fun to learn and study, tend to not pay well. And with that, we have a perfect segway to our next subject.</p></span>

                <h2 id="job">Work Expirience</h2>
               <p>I spent 5 years active duty, the better part of that as a bomb technician. This was a wonderful expirience and a great
                job. I deployed to Iraq, being in charge of over 2.5 million dollars worth of government equipment. However, I deployed 
                in 2010, during the drawdown, and so I did not see nearly as much expirience--or horror--as those who deployed during the 
                surge of 06-08. 

                I had the pleasure of teaching the newer folks, and realized just how much I love teaching, all shortly before I ETS'd out. 
                This lead to a few jobs, such as landscaping I did for a short season, before I was hired by Ligonier Ministries for customer 
                service and donor relations. I stuck with Ligonier for 5 years, transitioning to a few different roles, eventually working the last 
                year and half or so providing Live Chat support, interfacing with hundreds of customers. 

                I know work as an independent web developer, and have a few clients I work with providing monthly maintenance and support. My long 
                term goal is to either continue to grow my clientele, or find a programming job in Javascript, as a full-stack developer.
